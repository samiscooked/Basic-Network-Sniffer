ðŸ“¡ Basic Network Sniffer using Python
This project is a Basic Network Sniffer built in Python that captures and analyzes network packets on a local network interface. It was created as a hands-on exercise to understand how packet sniffing works and how attackers or defenders can monitor traffic at the network level.

ðŸ”§ Features
- Captures live packets from your local network interface
- Extracts and displays packet-level information (like source IP, destination IP, protocol, etc.)
- Supports saving captured data for later analysis
- Written using raw sockets and basic parsing logic

ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Raw Sockets (socket module)
- Root/Sudo access for interface-level capture

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals
- Understand how network sniffing tools like Wireshark or tcpdump function internally
- Learn about network packet structure (Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers)
- Develop skills in low-level network programming and cybersecurity basics
